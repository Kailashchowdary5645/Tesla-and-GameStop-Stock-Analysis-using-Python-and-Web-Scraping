**⚙️ How It Works**
Collect sensor data (pressure, flow rate, acoustic signals) from pipelines.

Preprocess the data and extract features.

Use supervised ML models to classify leaks vs. normal operations.

Trigger alerts when anomalies exceed thresholds.

Provide a dashboard for operators to monitor system status.

**🧪 Results**
Achieved 95%+ accuracy on test data with minimal false positives.

Real-time detection latency: <1 second per reading.
